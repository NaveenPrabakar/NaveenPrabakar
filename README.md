## 🧠 About Me

I like building systems where AI meets software engineering — connecting models, data, and infrastructure.
I’ve worked on everything from SQL Server optimization to LLM-powered tools and full-stack apps.
I care about making software that’s fast, reliable, and genuinely useful, and I’m always looking for ways to automate and improve how things work.
